                <p>Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization (IASTM) is a modern technique used in physiotherapy to treat soft tissue injuries, improve mobility, and enhance recovery. Using specially designed instruments, therapists can effectively target and break down scar tissue, adhesions, and other restrictions in the muscles, tendons, and fascia. This approach helps to promote healing, reduce pain, and improve function.</p>

                <h5>Benefits of IASTM</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduces pain and inflammation: The technique helps decrease muscle tension and improve circulation, which can lead to pain relief.</li>
                    <li>Speeds up recovery: Promotes faster healing by stimulating the body's natural repair processes.</li>
                    <li>Increases range of motion: Helps improve joint flexibility and overall movement.</li>
                    <li>Improves athletic performance: Can be used by athletes to enhance muscle function and prevent future injuries.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>What to Expect During an IASTM Session</h5>
                <p>During a session, the therapist will use an instrument to gently glide over the skin and apply pressure to the affected area. You may feel a mild sensation during treatment, which is generally not painful. Post-treatment, some people experience mild soreness similar to that of a deep tissue massage, but this usually subsides within a day or two.</p>
